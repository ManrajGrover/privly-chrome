Architecture of Injectable Applications

The injectable application folder is a  repository inside another repository. 
This is created with fake submodules using a method that can be found at this address:

The important information about this folder is that you cannot go into this folder and 
simply git pull it. If you absolutely need to do that you can just use:
rm -rf injectable_applications 

and then replace it with a clone yourself.
